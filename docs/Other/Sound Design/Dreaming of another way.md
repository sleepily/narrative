# Dreaming of another way
## Verse 1
It's never been easy
as a lost and hopeless soul
the things I'd rather never
see again

I've always been alone
even with all that was around
a never ending
vicious circle

## Chorus
When I fall asleep,
I get lost in golden dreams
of days we spent together
as one

And when I fall asleep,
I think of all the things
which keep me awake
throughout the day

But when I fall asleep,
I dream of another way

## Verse 2
I've never been good
with being on my own
another lost soul
could heal it all

But when it all comes down
a thunder without sound
I break apart in all
that's left of me

## Chorus
When I fall asleep,
I get lost in golden dreams
of days we spent together
as one

And when I fall asleep,
I think of all the things
which keep me alive
throughout the days

But when I fall asleep,
I dream of another way
(+1 oct)
I wish there was another way
